## Summary (Intent)

With these instructions the Aggregate structures on Alignment - Junctions exchange is established.

The test instruction specifies a dataset including two intersecting roads in a T junction (a secondary road ending at and joining a primary road).

The test instruction includes the main alignments for the primary and the secondary roads and alignments for the pavement edges where the two roads meet. In addition to these, an alignment is defined to separate the pavements belonging to the primary road from the pavements belonging to the secondary road.

For each road, the pavements aggregates of a couple of courses that are represented by IfcFacetedBrep. 

- Refer to [Test Case Imports](#Test-Case-Imports) to know the prerequisites for the present test.

- The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

- :zap: This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#validation-criteria) to understand what is required by the test :zap:

## Model Dataset

This test case utilises the dataset collected in the Dataset folder and summarised in the table below. **For more details on each item see [Dataset description](Dataset/README.md).**

| Filename                                                     | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| [HorizontalAlignmentParameters](Dataset/HorizontalAlignmentParameters.csv) | Parameters for the horizontal segments as csv |
| [VerticalAlignmentParameters](Dataset/VerticalAlignmentParameters.csv) | Parameters for the vertical segments as csv   |

## Test Case Imports

Test instructions are defined with a modular approach to reduce repetition of validation criteria and test content, and improve vendors ability to solve issues and bugs. therefore this test instruction *imports/reuses* the following Test instructions and entities with the relevant associated validation criteria.

| TI Code | Test Instruction Title | Comments |
| ------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| -       | -                      | na       |

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

Considering the aim of this test, other **optional** results, not subject to the bSI certification process, yet usefull to illustrate test results are:
- Screen-shot of a planar view and a "long section" similar to the provided examples
- CSV export of the horizontal and vertical alignment segment parameters

## Validation criteria
:zap: For this test case to be considered passed **all capabilities listed in this section**, and **the ones of pre-required tests** shall be verified, with no exception. :zap:
