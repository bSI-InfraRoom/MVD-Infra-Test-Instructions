## Summary (Intent)

With these instructions the infrastructure (e.g. Road) alignment exchange is established. This test instruction use the same alignment definition as [ALIN06](../ALIN06).

The data comes from, and is a simplified version of, the IFC Infra Unit Test [MCON-2](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-infra-unit-test/tree/main/MCON-2) which in turn is extracted from the IFC Rail [Level Crossing storyline](https://github.com/IFCRail/IFC-Rail-Unit-Test/tree/master/8_Storylines%20Test%20(SL)/SL08_Level%20Crossing).

## Model Dataset

This test case utilises the dataset collected in the Dataset folder and summarised in the table below. **For more details on each item see [Dataset description](Dataset/README.md).**

| Filename                                                     | Type (format) | Description                                  |

## Test Case Imports

Test instructions are defined with a modular approach to reduce repetition of validation criteria and test content, and improve vendors ability to solve issues and bugs. therefore this test instruction *imports/reuses* the following Test instructions and entities with the relevant associated validation criteria.

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

Considering the aim of this test, other **optional** results, not subject to the bSI certification process, yet usefull to illustrate test results are:
- Screen-shot of a planar view and a "long section" showing the superelevation changes

## Validation criteria
:zap: For this test case to be considered passed **all capabilities** listed in this section shall be verified, with no exception. :zap:
