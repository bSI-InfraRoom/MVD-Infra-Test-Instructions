## Summary (Intent)

*Include a short description of the test case. This description should include a summary of the capabilities and data representations being tested by the defined data set.*

With these instructions the infrastructure (e.g. Road) alignment exchange is established.
This includes basic alignment geometry featuring the common layout:

- horizontal
- vertical

The valid geometry segment types for horizontal are the following:

- Arc
- Clothoid
- Linear
- *Check if other transition curves are being used*

The valid geometry segment types for vertical:

- Linear
- Circular Arc 
- Parabolic Arc
- *Check if there are cases with transition curves (don't think that there are)*

...

We could use the alignment geometry from [MCON-2](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-infra-unit-test/tree/main/MCON-2). However, that would need elaboration (there are no clothoids and no parabolic arcs).

The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

:zap: **This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#Validation-Criteria) to understand what is required by the test** :zap:

## Itemised Roots
*This section lists the primary entities and concept templates being validated by this test instruction, these are listed to understand the scope of the data entities being addressed. this is the documentation of the data placed within BIMQ*

The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

:construction: under construction :construction:

<details><summary>IFC Entities</summary>

These entities represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the entire MVD.**

- *IfcAlignment*
- *IfcAlignmentHorizontal*
- *IfcAlignmentVertical*
- *IfcAlignmentSegment*
- *IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment*
- *IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment*
- *IfcAxis2PlacementLinear*
- *IfcAxis2Placement2D*
- *IfcAxis2Placement3D*
- *IfcCircle*
- *IfcClothoid*
- *IfcCompositeCurve*
- *IfcCurveSegment*
- *IfcLine*
- *IfcLinearPlacement*
- *IfcLocalPlacement*
- *IfcGeometricRepresentationContext*
- *IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext*
- *IfcGradientCurve*
- *IfcMapConversion*
- *IfcPolyline*
- *IfcProject*
- *IfcProjectedCRS*
- *IfcProductDefinitionShape*
- *IfcSite*
- *IfcShapeRepresentation*

</details>

<details><summary>Concept Templates</summary>

These concept templates represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD, that must be correctly exported to meet the validation criteria. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the entire MVD.**

- *Alignment Layout*
- *Alignment Geometry*
- *Alignment Geometry Gradient*
- *Project Global Positioning*
- *Spatial Containment*

## Test Case Imports
Test instructions are defined with a modular approach to reduce repetition of validation criteria and test content, and improve vendors ability to solve issues and bugs. therefore this test instruction *imports/reuses* the following Test instructions and entities with the relevant associated validation criteria.

## Usages, Constraints & Logic
The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

<details><summary>Semantic Usages, Constraints & Logic</summary>

The following itemised Usages, Constraints & Logic are normative entries within the AbRV MVD and MUST be satisfied to meet the defined validation criteria

<details><summary>Model Geometry</summary>
The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:

- *Constraint*

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

:construction: under construction :construction:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

Considering the aim of this test, other **optional** results, not subject to the bSI certification process, yet usefull to illustrate test results are:
- Screen-shot of ...
- CSV export of ...

## Validation criteria
:zap: For this test case to be considered passed **all capabilities** listed in this section shall be verified, with no exception. :zap:
