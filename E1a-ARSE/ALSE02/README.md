## Summary (Intent)

With these instructions the infrastructure (e.g. Road) alignment exchange is established. This test instruction use the same alignment definition as [ALIN06](../ALIN06).

The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

The data comes from, and is a simplified version of, the IFC Infra Unit Test [MCON-2](https://github.com/bSI-InfraRoom/IFC-infra-unit-test/tree/main/MCON-2) which in turn is extracted from the IFC Rail [Level Crossing storyline](https://github.com/IFCRail/IFC-Rail-Unit-Test/tree/master/8_Storylines%20Test%20(SL)/SL08_Level%20Crossing). 

:zap: **This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#Validation-Criteria) to understand what is required by the test** :zap:

## Itemised Roots
*This section lists the primary entities and concept templates being validated by this test instruction, these are listed to understand the scope of the data entities being addressed. this is the documentation of the data placed within BIMQ*

The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

:construction: under construction :construction:

<details><summary>IFC Entities</summary>

These entities represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the entire MVD.**

- Inherited from imported tests:
  - Model setup
    - *IfcSite*
    - *IfcRoad*
    - *IfcRepresentationContext*
    - *IfcMapConversion*

  - *IfcPropertySingleValue*
  - *IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue*
  - *IfcLinearPlacement*

</details>

<details><summary>Concept Templates</summary>

These concept templates represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD, that must be correctly exported to meet the validation criteria. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the entire MVD.**

- Inherited from imported tests:
  - *Project Units*
  - *Project Representation Context*
  - *Project Global Positioning*
  - *Spatial Decomposition*
  - *Spatial Composition*
  - *Spatial Container*
  - *Alignment Decomposition*
  - *Alignment Geometry Gradient*
  - *Product Local Placement*

- For this test instruction:
  - *Product Linear Placement*
  - *Property Sets for Objects*
  - Product Relative Positioning

## Test Case Imports
Test instructions are defined with a modular approach to reduce repetition of validation criteria and test content, and improve vendors ability to solve issues and bugs. therefore this test instruction *imports/reuses* the following Test instructions and entities with the relevant associated validation criteria.

| **ID** | **CRITERIA**                         | **VALUE**                           | **COMMENT** |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| SE_00  | Superelevation structure is verified | See below for further specification |             |
| SE_01  | Width structure is verified          | See below for further specification |             |

SE_00: Superelevation structure is verified

>1. The dataset shall contain 12 superelevation event instances, each represented by an `IfcAnnotation` with `PredefinedType=.SUPERELEVATIONEVENT.`
>2. Each superelevation event shall have an associated `IfcLinearPlacement` relative to the alignment curve according to CT Product Linear Placement at the specified locations
>2. Each superelevation event shall be positioned relative to the `IfcAlignment` using `IfcRelPositions` according to CT Product Relative Positioning
>3. Each superelevation event shall have an associated Property set with the name `Pset_Superelevation` according to CT Property sets For Objects
>4. Each `Pset_Superelevation` shall have properties `Side`, `Superelevation` and `TransitionSuperelevation` set to the specified values.

SE_01: Width structure is verified

>1. The dataset shall contain 8 width event instances, each represented by an `IfcAnnotation` with `PredefinedType=.WIDTHEVENT.`
>2. Each width event shall have an associated `IfcLinearPlacement` relative to the alignment curve according to CT Product Linear Placement at the specified locations
>2. Each width event shall be positioned relative to the `IfcAlignment` using `IfcRelPositions` according to CT Product Relative Positioning
>3. Each width event shall have an associated Property set with the name `Pset_Width` according to CT Property sets For Objects
>4. Each `Pset_Width` shall have properties `Side`, `NominalWidth` and `TransitionWidth` set to the specified values.

</details>

<details><summary>Model Geometry</summary>
The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:
Neither the superelevation events nor the Width events needs explicit geometric representation.
</details>

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

:construction: under construction :construction:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

Considering the aim of this test, other **optional** results, not subject to the bSI certification process, yet usefull to illustrate test results are:
- Screen-shot of a planar view and a "long section" showing the superelevation and width changes or a table showing the same information

## Validation criteria
:zap: For this test case to be considered passed **all capabilities** listed in this section shall be verified, with no exception. :zap:
