## Summary (Intent)

With these instructions the infrastructure (e.g. Road) alignment exchange is established. This test instruction use the same alignment definition as [ALIN02](../ALIN02) and adds a geometric definition.

## Test Case Imports
Test instructions are defined with a modular approach to reduce repetition of validation criteria and test content, and improve vendors ability to solve issues and bugs. therefore this test instruction *imports/reuses* the following Test instructions and entities with the relevant associated validation criteria.

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

:construction: under construction :construction:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

Considering the aim of this test, other **optional** results, not subject to the bSI certification process, yet usefull to illustrate test results are:
- Screen-shot of a planar view and a "long section" similar to the provided examples
- CSV export of the horizontal and vertical alignment segment parameters

## Validation criteria
:zap: For this test case to be considered passed **all capabilities** listed in this section shall be verified, with no exception. :zap:
